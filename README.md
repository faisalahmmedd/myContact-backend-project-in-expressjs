## This is my first backend project
 This is contact management backend project. In this project i used ExpressJs and MongoDB. <br><br>
 In the project, a user can <br>
  1. sign up, <br>  2. log in. <br> 3. After log in a token is generated. With the token the authorization
is verified.<br>  4. And a logged in user can create <br><br> I. a new contact, <br> II. update an existing contact, <br> III. delete an existing contact <br> IV. and can get all the created contacts.
